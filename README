Hexy is an open source utility designed to make embedded development in C easier when you need to create a hex array from a binary file.

Drag and drop files onto the GUI to start conversion. An "h" file is then created for each file that was dragged on to the application.

Hexy is written in Lazarus http://lazarus.freepascal.org and requires Lazarus 0.9.28 or later. It is cross platform and has been tested on Windows and Linux.
